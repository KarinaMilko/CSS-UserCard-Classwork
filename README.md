# CSS-UserCard-Classwork

This repository contains the **"User Card" classwork project**, completed during lectures, which focuses on fundamental CSS layout and code organization skills.

## Goal:

## Technologies: 
HTML, CSS (Box Model, Inline-Block Layout, CSS Variables, Font Awesome)

## Features:

Semantic HTML structure for the card.

Styling using CSS Variables (var()), which serve as the Single Source of Truth for colors and sizes.

Creating an overlapping element effect (photo on background) using Negative Margin.

Managing internal element layout (like counters and buttons) using Inline-Block Layout and text-align centering.

Image styling: using object-fit for correct display and border rounding (border-radius).

Integration and styling of icons (Font Awesome) and buttons.
